<h1>Document Using Incident Handler Report</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project simulated a scenario in which a small U.S. health care clinic experienced a ransomeware attack from an organized group of unethical hackers. My job was to provide a detailed incident report to the company. This report ensured important information was not lost or overlooked and could be used for future incidents. 

<br />


<h2>Goals</h2>
The goal is to create a detailed incident report to provide integral information to the company for future references as well as suggestions for preventing the likelihood future ransomware attacks.

<h2>Framework and Guidelines </h2>

<h2>Incident handler's journal</h2>

| Date: May 18, 2024 | Entry: \#1 |  |  |

| Description | Documenting a ransomware attack of a small U.S health care clinic. |  |  |
| Tool(s) used | N/A |  |  |
| The 5 W's  | **Who**: An organized group of unethical hackers who target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. **What**: A ransomware attack preventing employees from accessing files like medical records and software for business operations.  **Where**: At a small U.S. health care clinic. **When**: Tuesday 9:00 a.m. **Why**: This occurred when malicious hackers gained access to the company’s systems through a phishing attack. Once inside, they deployed ransomware, encrypting essential files needed for business operations. The attackers’ intent seems to be financially motivated, as indicated by the ransom note they left, which demanded a significant sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. |  |  |
| Additional notes | Awareness training for phishing attacks could be beneficial in preventing the likelihood of a ransomware attack occurring again.  How can the company ensure paying the attackers will grant them the decryption key? |  |  |

<h2>Summary </h2>
Based on the information given within the scenario, I used the Incident Handler's Report to document the incident, so important information was not overlooked or lost.
