| The 5 W's  | **Who**: An organized group of unethical hackers who target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. **What**: A ransomware attack preventing employees from accessing files like medical records and software for business operations.  **Where**: At a small U.S. health care clinic. **When**: Tuesday 9:00 a.m. **Why**: This occurred when malicious hackers gained access to the company’s systems through a phishing attack. Once inside, they deployed ransomware, encrypting essential files needed for business operations. The attackers’ intent seems to be financially motivated, as indicated by the ransom note they left, which demanded a significant sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. |  |  |
| Additional notes | Awareness training for phishing attacks could be beneficial in preventing the likelihood of a ransomware attack occurring again.  How can the company ensure paying the attackers will grant them the decryption key? |  |  |
